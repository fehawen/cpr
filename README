cpr - change palette randomly
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change your terminal colors randomly and on the fly with a selection of matching
dark and light palettes.


install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clone the repo.

    $ cd && git clone https://github.com/fehawen/cpr.git

Run make to install. This will install cpr to ~/bin by default, because that's
the way I like it. Do not run the command as root.

    $ make install

Set the environment variable CPR_LIB to point to this directory, and persist
colors, by adding the following to whichever shellrc you're using.

    export CPR_LIB=~/cpr
    cpr revive


palettes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looking for more alternatives? There's a collection of Katsushika Hokusai
palettes you can use as well: https://github.com/fehawen/hokusai
